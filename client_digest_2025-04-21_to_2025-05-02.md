The report highlights that most recent submissions received quick pass decisions from the Netic team. The company appears to have a very high hiring bar, prioritizing candidates with strong university credentials and exceptional signals of excellence. The pattern of passes suggests that candidate profile calibration may be needed to better align submissions with Netic's expectations.

For active candidates, Aristos Athens is the only submission currently advancing in the process with a scheduled introductory call. Follow-up is needed to understand the outcome of this conversation and to ensure Kuai has received proper closure on his candidacy.
